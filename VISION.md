# Vision – I.R.I.S.
**Intelligent Rendering & Image Synthesis**

## What is I.R.I.S.?

I.R.I.S. is not just an AI image generator.

It is a **foundation** — a flexible, open, hardware-agnostic platform for AI image generation that anyone can build upon.

Just like Linux is not a single operating system but a base for countless distributions,  
**I.R.I.S. is meant to be the Linux of AI image generation.**

## Core Philosophy

### 🔓 Open by Design
- Fully open-source
- No vendor lock-in
- No forced cloud dependency
- Self-hosted by default

---

### 🧩 Modular Architecture
- Models are interchangeable
- UI is replaceable
- Backends can evolve independently
- Web, API, Discord, CLI — all optional layers

---

### 🖥️ Hardware Freedom
I.R.I.S. should run on:
- NVIDIA (CUDA)
- AMD (ROCm / HIP)
- Intel (Arc / XPU)
- Apple Silicon (Metal)
- CPU-only systems (with limitations)

No hardware vendor should define who can create.

---

### 🌐 From Local to Global
I.R.I.S. works:
- On a single gaming PC
- On a home server
- In a private studio
- In a full AI data center

Same software. Different scale.

---

### 🧠 Creator-First
- Artists keep control
- Developers can fork freely
- Studios can build products on top
- Communities can create their own distributions

---

## What I.R.I.S. Is NOT

- ❌ A closed SaaS product
- ❌ A crypto platform
- ❌ A data-harvesting service
- ❌ A single-model solution

---

## Long-Term Goal

Create an ecosystem where:
- Anyone can generate images locally
- Anyone can build AI services ethically
- Anyone can contribute, regardless of budget

**AI creativity should not be reserved for corporations.**

> I.R.I.S. is not owned by hardware.
> It is not owned by the cloud.
> It belongs to the community.
